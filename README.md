This is a demo/pilot Streamlit tool that is written in a Jupyter notebook.
This app demonstrates a storyboard ideation using an LLM model (Gemini).
1) The app calls Gemini to generate one current TikTok trend and a catchy ideation story based on the trend.
2) From the generated storyline, Gemini Nano Banana is used to produce sample images to support the storyboarding activity.
