This is a demo/pilot Streamlit tool that is written in a Jupyter notebook.
This app demonstrates a storyboard ideation using an LLM model (Gemini).
1) The app calls Gemini to generate one current TikTok trend and a catchy ideation story based on the trend.
2) From the generated storyline, Gemini Nano Banana is used to produce sample images to support the storyboarding activity.
The tool can be tried out at the link <https://content-ideation-app.streamlit.app/>
